## Decadal hindcasts

The EUCP project contributed several decadal hindcasts to the [Decadal Climate Prediction Project](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/modelling-wgcm-mip-catalogue/cmip6-endorsed-mips-article/1065-modelling-cmip6-dcpp) (DCPP). Most of these hindcasts belong to the component A of DCPP, which designs and organizes a coordinated decadal hindcast experiment, in conjunction with the seasonal prediction and climate modelling communities, and the production of a comprehensive archive of results for research and applications.

Hindcasts are forecasts for the past performed with the same forecast system. They can be compared with observations, and thus identify systematic errors (i.e. biases) and estimate their magnitude, as well as the performance of the forecast system, from a variety of perspectives.

## Data access

The following datasets have been contributed by EUCP:

- [BSC Increased resolution hindcasts](https://doi.org/0): Increased resolution
  decadal hindcasts with EC-Earth3 at T551/ORCA025. Initialized every 2 years
  (November 1st) from 1960 to present. 10 members, 5-years +2 month long
  simulations. Output as described in CMIP6 DCPP-A.

- [CNRS/IPSL-EPOC Increased resolution
  hindcasts](https://doi.org/10.22033/ESGF/CMIP6.5137):
  Decadal hindcasts with improved initialization strategy and increased
  resolution using IPSL-CM6A-LR at about 1Â° resolution. Initialized every year
  from 1960 to present. 10 members, 10-year-long simulations.

- [IPSL DCPP-A data for CMIP5 and
  CMIP6](https://doi.org/10.22033/ESGF/CMIP6.5137):
  DCPP-A from CMIP5, using IPSL-CM5A-LR, initialized from nudged simulation
  using SST nudging only. Start dates every year from 1960 to 2015, 3 members.
  De-biased data from CMIP5. Using CDFt technique (quantile-quantile approach),
  the CMIP5 data have been debiased.

  Increased resolution decadal hindcasts with EC-Earth3 at T511/ORCA025.
  Initialized 1 Nov 1990-2004, 10 members each, integrated for 5 years + 2
  months. Output as described in CMIP6 DCPP-A (Tier 1).
