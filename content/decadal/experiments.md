The EUCP project also contributed to the [Decadal Climate Prediction Project](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/modelling-wgcm-mip-catalogue/cmip6-endorsed-mips-article/1065-modelling-cmip6-dcpp) (DCPP), component A, B and C. More details about these experiments can be found in the [experiment protocol](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/experimental-protocol) of DCPP.

In EUCP project, we explore avenues to improve the next generation of climate predictions with experiments on the impact of resolution, initialisation, forecast drift reduction and short-lived climate forcings.
