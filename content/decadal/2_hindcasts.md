Hindcasts are forecasts for the past performed with the same forecast system. They can be used to describe the climatology of the model, and thus identify systematic errors (i.e. biases) and estimate their magnitude, as well as the performance of the forecast system, from a variety of perspectives.

Despite of the high expense, in EUCP project, sets of hindcasts are performed over a period in the past to test the forecast systems. These hindcasts contribute to the [Decadal Climate Prediction Project](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/modelling-wgcm-mip-catalogue/cmip6-endorsed-mips-article/1065-modelling-cmip6-dcpp) (DCPP). Most of these hindcasts belong to the component A of DCPP, which designs and organizes a coordinated decadal hindcast experiment, in conjunction with the seasonal prediction and climate modelling communities, and the production of a comprehensive archive of results for research and applications.
