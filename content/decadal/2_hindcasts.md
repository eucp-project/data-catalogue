    details: DCPP-A from CMIP5, using IPSL-CM5A-LR, initialized from nudged simulation using SST nudging only. Start dates every year from 1960 to 2015, 3 members. De-biased data from CMIP5. Using CDFt technique (quantile-quantile approach), the CMIP5 data have been debiased.

The EUCP project contributed several decadal hindcasts to the [Decadal Climate Prediction Project](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/modelling-wgcm-mip-catalogue/cmip6-endorsed-mips-article/1065-modelling-cmip6-dcpp) (DCPP). Most of these hindcasts belong to the component A of DCPP, which designs and organizes a coordinated decadal hindcast experiment, in conjunction with the seasonal prediction and climate modelling communities, and the production of a comprehensive archive of results for research and applications.

Hindcasts are forecasts for the past performed with the same forecast system. They can be compared with observations, and thus identify systematic errors (i.e. biases) and estimate their magnitude, as well as the performance of the forecast system, from a variety of perspectives.
