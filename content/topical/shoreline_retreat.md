Probabilistic projections of sea level rise (SLR) induced in Europe using the Bruun rule model and regional probabilistic SLR projections under RCP 4.5 and a high-end RCP 8.5 scenarios. Four different combinations of sandy beach location and nearshore slope data result in four different projections of shoreline retreat along the European coastline.
