Large ensemble climate modelling time series for the Rhine catchment. <!--more-->The dataset contains three ensembles (present-day, pre-industrial + 2C-warming, pre-industrial + 3C-warming) of 2000 years each, various variables related to drought are included. All data is derived from the EC-Earth global climate model ([v2, Hazeleger et al. 2012, DOI 10.1007/s00382-011-1228-5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-011-1228-5)). Descriptions of large ensemble experimental setup can be found in Van der Wiel et al. ([2019, DOI 10.1029/2019GL081967](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL081967)).

Additionally, three sets of storylines of droughts similar to the western European drought of 2018 are included. These are the simulated events selected from the large ensembles, using metrics 1, 2 and 3 of Van der Wiel et al. ([2021, DOI 10.1016/j.wace.2021.100350](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094721000438)).
