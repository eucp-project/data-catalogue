Global nearshore slope estimations using an interpolated MERIT+GEBCO merged
dataset with the Open Street Maps (OSM) coastline as Mean Sea Level (MSL). The
slope was calculated from elevation profiles that were created by transects
perpendicular to the OSM coastline, positioned every 1 km in the alongshore
direction. The depths of closure that were used for the slope estimation are
also provided.
