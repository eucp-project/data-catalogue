Ensembles of hydrological simulations using the Community Water Model (CWatM)
based on different EURO-CORDEX forcing. 
<!--more-->
Different model ensembles for natural and human water use conditions. Model: Community Water Model (CWatM) Model setup: (i) natural, (ii) human water use Forc-ing: 25 EURO-CORDEX ensemble members Variables: discharge, runoff, ET, water use: agricultural, industrial, domestic water demand Resolution: 5 minutes, monthly Domain: Europe
(34째N-71째N,11째W-40째E), including most major river basins, except for some
eastern European basins (e.g., Volga)
