    <h1>Data access</h1>
    <p>
      We are currently in the process of uploading the data to ESGF. Once the
      data is available there, we will provide instructions on how to access it.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are looking into possibilities of making pre-processed subsets of the data available through zenodo:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Link 1</li>
      <li>Link 2</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
