    <h4>C3S sectoral applications of decadal predictions</h4>
    <p>
      In addition to the outputs shown on here, EUCP partners have collaborated
      with C3S in a dedicated C3S project to develop demonstrators around
      sectoral applications of decadal predictions. More information about this
      can be found on the <a
